This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

 
These are the following packages I will use. Make sure you have installed them first on your machine
```{r}
library(scales)
library(zoo)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2) 
library(grid)
library(gridExtra)
library(lubridate)
```

Cleaning the Loan Summary Data
```{r Reading and Cleaning Loan Summary Data, echo=TRUE}
loans <- read_excel(path = "Econ -419 term paper/Loan_Summary.xlsx", skip = 4)

#Converting the first column to a yearqtr, a class to represent quarterly data. 
(loans_year <- as.character(loans[,1, drop = TRUE]))
loans[,1] <- as.yearqtr(format(loans_year), "%Y%q")
str(loans)
```

Plotting Outstanding debt of all loans v. time
```{r}
DDL <- ggplot(loans, aes(x = Fiscal_Year, y = DDL_Outstanding)) + geom_line(color = "blue") + scale_x_yearqtr(format = "%Y Q%q") + 
  scale_y_continuous(label = dollar) + ylab("Debt (in Billions)") + ggtitle("Direct Loans") +
  xlab("Fiscal Year") 
  
DDL <- DDL + theme_bw()
  
FFEL <- ggplot(loans, aes(x = Fiscal_Year, y = FFEL_Outstanding)) + geom_line(color = "green") + scale_x_yearqtr(format = "%Y Q%q") + 
  scale_y_continuous(label = dollar) + ylab("Debt (in Billions)") + ggtitle("Federal Family Education") +
  xlab("Fiscal Year")

FFEL <- FFEL + theme_bw()

Perkins <- ggplot(loans, aes(x = Fiscal_Year, y = PL_Outstanding)) + geom_line(color = "red") + 
  scale_x_yearqtr(format = "%Y Q%q") + ylab("Debt (in Billions)") + ggtitle("Perkins") + xlab("Fiscal Year")
  xlab("Fiscal Year")

Perkins <- Perkins + theme_bw()
grid.arrange(DDL, FFEL, Perkins, nrow = 3)

```

A Brief look at College Costs

```{r}
costs <- read_excel(path = "Econ -419 term paper/College_Costs.xlsx")
costs[,2] <- as.numeric(costs[,2, drop = T], na.rm = T)
head(costs)
```
This data looks at the Average total tuition, fees, room and board rates charged for full-time undergraduate students. More information can be found at https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=76

```{r}
costs_plot <- ggplot(costs, aes(x = Years)) +
    #first layer
    geom_point(aes(y = Public), color = "red") + theme_bw() + scale_y_continuous(label = dollar) +
    #second layer
    geom_point(aes(y = Private), color = "blue") + theme_bw() + scale_y_continuous(label = dollar)

#Adding main titles
costs_plot <- costs_plot + 
    ylab("College Cost") +
    labs(title = "Costs of 4-Year and 2-Year Colleges",
         subtitle = "in 2016-17 dollars", 
         caption = "Source: https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=76. 
         Red and blue plots represent public and private institutions respectively. Years include 1985, 1995, and 2000-2016. 
         Original data not in the excel format.")
