# Are Student Loans Worth it? What are the financial outcomes for students who borrow to go to college? 

# What do I already know about this topic?

For the past few years, student loans have received a lot of attention in the media.  
According to these news articles and magazines, student debts are a burden and a symptom of many problems in higher education, 
such as low public funding of colleges and high college attendance costs. One possible explanation for the increase in costs is
that the increase in demand for a college education could be raising the costs of college.   

Per the National Center of Education Statistics, the average cost of college for full-time undergraduate students has more than
doubled since 1985.  Both trends, the costs for college and increased demand for college, are correlated with the increase in 
outstanding debt for direct loans (see the png files). Findings on the impact of student loans on students’ financials and lifestyles after 
graduation tell a story of struggle and general dissatisfaction. In its 2016 nationally representative survey, 
the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) reported that more than half of Americans with student loan debt (51%) had a 
problem making a student loan monthly payment at least once. Moreover, forty-four percent said they "cut back on day-to-day 
living expenses," while more than one-third (37%) said they "delayed saving for retirement or other financial goals."  

Given the problems, some have begun to question the value of higher education. For instance, Dr. Bryan Caplan of George Mason 
University argues in “The Case Against Education” that the role of education is to certify a student’s intelligence and work 
ethic, not to increase people’s human capital.  

To finance higher education, students can take out either private or government student loans, and it is interesting to think 
about how students come to decide on which loans to use. Rational students considering the government loans will consider 
whether or not loans are subsidized, and how generous loan forgiveness programs, grace periods, deferment conditions are. 
These students will also know of private loans and for-profit schools that offer more merit-based scholarships to avoid debt.  
Finally, rational students will choose to go to college only if both the financial and effort costs will be less than the 
increase in wages if he/she did not go to college. Therefore, information (or lack thereof) plays a significant role in 
people’s decisions to take out loans which determines how much debt one might have to repay after graduation. 


# Literature to look at 
Most of this paper's literature review will be from peer-reviewed economics journals that focus on financial outcomes 
such as life-time earnings and incomes for people who used student loans to earn a college degree. 
Ideally, the literature should compare the financial outcomes for students in debt to students not in debt after controlling 
for variables like socioeconomic status, race, gender, degree, college attended, and much more.


I intend to begin this paper by looking at literature that focuses on what types of students and parents choose student loans, 
and what factors affect their willingness to borrow. After that, I intend to look at differences in labor market outcomes for 
people with and without student loans.  Most of the financial analysis will focus on repayment burdens, net worth, retirement 
savings, and other measures of financial well-being. Finally, I want to see how students of different backgrounds perceive 
their student loans. I expect perceptions of student loans and outcomes to differ among majors, race, and socioeconomic status. 

Considering that student loans’ recipients have to navigate several rules and regulations, I intend to complement this study 
with law review articles to further explore the role of information or the effects of certain policy changes or changes in 
essential government programs that offer student loans.
